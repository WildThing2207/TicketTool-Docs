# Meet your Support Team

## BattleEye - Developer/Creator
Josiah (a.k.a. BattleEye) singlehandedly developed Ticket Tool and its Dashboard.  He is constantly working on, developing, and adding new features to Ticket Tool.

## Admins
### Pinecone
Pinecone was the first member of the Ticket Tool Support Team and has always worked hard to provide fast, reliable support to everybody who creates a ticket.  He soon after became the first Admin of the Ticket Tool Support Server and now leads the Spanish Support Team and Co-Leads the support team as a whole as well as handling a large portion of modderation within the community.

### TrackerGaming
Tracker followed soon after Gideon and was the third member of Ticket Tool's Support Team and second administration. He helps to manage Ticket Tool's Public Relations and Social Media presense.  Since he is also an admin on many other Discord servers, he was a perfect fit for the job.

### Spicy_Halapenjo
"Hey! I am Spicy_Halapenjo (SpicyHalapenjo#5918) and I am an Administrator and part of the Support Team at Ticket Tool. I love interacting with our customers on a daily basis and helping them with any questions or problems they may have. Aside from Ticket Tool, I am also the Head of Customer Support at Fortnite Master, which is a global Fortnite Statistics Tracker and have the same role at vShield Services, which is a Premium VPN, RDP and Web Hosting company. I love the Ticket Tool Bot as it is extremely well thought through and executed as well as being unlike any other ticketing bot on the market. The pricing is reasonable and affordable and the bot developer listens to the customers and takes their feedback on board. Feel free to contact the Support Team on our Discord Server and I would be more than happy to help you out!"

"Hello, i'm known as Tobi. I'm one of the most recent Support members, I keep promoting the bot in the spanish community, and also i manage the brazilian team. Since the day i joined the support server i've tried to help on everything i can. Aside from Ticket Tool, i make music and i'm the CEO of one of the most wanted Grand Theft Autos San Andreas multiplayer spanish servers of 2019. Here are some of my wishes:
I want Ticket Tool to be one of the most recognized bots in Discord Â¿Why? - Because it's a complete bot, easy to understand and constantly being developed by BattleEye. Also we try to do our best with fast reply when people ask for support.
Someday leave my countr.y Â¿Why? - . . .

### NoahTheReal
NoahTheReal is part of the support team and takes care of the German and English questions that arise when using the bots. Shortly after the transition from Ticket Tool v2 to v3, he was the first German supporter to join the team to handle the growing number of (German) support requests. Meanwhile he is the "Multicultural Team Leader" and takes care of the management and supervision of the LOTE (Languages Other Than English) Support Teams . However, he has been using and promoting the Ticket Tool as a support solution on his Discord servers for some time now.  Noah actively supports some of the largest German Ticket Tool partner servers and is therefore very familiar with the use of the Ticket Tool on large servers. 

### Delarobia

### OreoDipped
My name is OreoDipped.  I am a new English support for TicketTool.  I got on the team at 8/3/19 at 12:19 am. To be honest, I was very surprised that I got onto the team.  I felt nervous about the questions, but surprisingly, I got them all right.  When I heard that, I got a boost of confidence.  Know that I'm confident, I glad to be on the team and to be selected out of around 40 other people.  I will try my best to be as active as I can to help others either questions /problems.

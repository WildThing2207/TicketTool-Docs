### Ctrl_Alt_LogiQ
> Hey! I am Ctrl_Alt_LogiQ (Ctrl_Alt_LogiQ#5918) and I am an Administrator and part of the Support Team at Ticket Tool. I love interacting with our customers on a daily basis and helping them with any questions or problems they may have. Aside from Ticket Tool, I am also the Head of Customer Support at Fortnite Master, which is a global Fortnite Statistics Tracker and have the same role at vShield Services, which is a Premium VPN, RDP and Web Hosting company. I love the Ticket Tool Bot as it is extremely well thought through and executed as well as being unlike any other ticketing bot on the market. The pricing is reasonable and affordable and the bot developer listens to the customers and takes their feedback on board. Feel free to contact the Support Team on our Discord Server and I would be more than happy to help you out!

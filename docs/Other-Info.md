# Quick Start

## Permissions

All permissions set on the parent category will be used on each ticket opened under that category

You can use this to set different roles to view different types of tickets

## Limits

Discord has a limit of `50` channels per category, If you reach this limit a duplicate category will be created and used in it's place

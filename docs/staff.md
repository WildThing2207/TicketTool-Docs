##BattleEye - Developer/Creator
BattleEye singlehandedly developed Ticket Tool and its Dashboard.  He is constantly working on, developing, and adding new features to Ticket Tool.

##Admins
###Pinecone
Pinecone was the first member of the Ticket Tool Support Team and has always worked hard to provide fast, reliable support to everybody who creates a ticket.  He soon after became the first Admin of the Ticket Tool Support Server and now leads the Spanish Support Team and Co-Leads the support team as a whole as well as handling a large portion of modderation within the community.

###Gideon
Gideon is a very seniored member of the Ticket Tool support server.  He was the second Support Team member and Second Admin as well.  He handles a majority of support tickets in the server as well as most of the server's bots and modderation setups.  Without him, the Ticket Tool Support Server would not be as simple and streamlined as it is today.

###TrackerGaming
Tracker followed soon after Gideon and was the third member of Ticket Tool's Support Team and Administration. He helps to manage Ticket Tool's PR and Social Media prescense.  Since he is also an admin on many other Discord servers, he was a perfect fit for the job.

###Spicy_Halapenjo
"Hey! I am Spicy_Halapenjo (SpicyHalapenjo#5918) and I am an Administrator and part of the Support Team at Ticket Tool. I love interacting with our customers on a daily basis and helping them with any questions or problems they may have. Aside from Ticket Tool, I am also the Head of Customer Support at Fortnite Master, which is a global Fortnite Statistics Tracker and have the same role at vShield Services, which is a Premium VPN, RDP and Web Hosting company. I love the Ticket Tool Bot as it is extremely well thought through and executed as well as being unlike any other ticketing bot on the market. The pricing is reasonable and affordable and the bot developer listens to the customers and takes their feedback on board. Feel free to contact the Support Team on our Discord Server and I would be more than happy to help you out!"

```WildThing bio```
> One of the best, WildThing is not your standard guy; more akin a bear, he is feisty, driven, and gets things done. When not intimidating campers, he helps out the Ticket Tool team and tries to read books - but ends up tearing their delicate pages.
or
> WildThing is a mid/end-of-life years old who enjoys sailing, walking and theatre. He is patient and caring. He also has the best smug face and sleep when you talk too much.
